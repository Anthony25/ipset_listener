IPset listener
=============

Handles a white-list in ipset, through a hash:mac set by default, containing
a set of mac addresses.


Dependencies
------------

  * rustc, tested with version 1.7
  * cargo, tested with version 0.8

These dependencies are needed to compile the project, but are not needed if you
just want to run it.


Configuration
-------------

Copy the example file `ipset_listener.conf` as `/etc/ipset_listener.conf`,
then adapt it to your setup. Each option in the example is documented.


Usage
-----

Just compile the project with `cargo build --release`, and then start the
binary `ipset_listener`. It should spawn a server, listening with a TCPSocket
on the addresses/ports you have set in your configuration file.

Then, from any client connected to your server, you can manage your white-list
with specific commands.


Commands
--------

  * `a <mac_address>`: add the mac address to the white-list
  * `d <mac_address>`: delete the mac address of the white-list
